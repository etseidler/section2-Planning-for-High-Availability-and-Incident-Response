AMI IDs from installation step:

# original, in us-east-1
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-138-165-109 ~]$ aws ec2 create-restore-image-task --object-key ami-0ec6fdfb365e5fc00.bin --bucket udacity-srend --name "udacity-seidler"
{
    "ImageId": "ami-04cba4f37077b5859"
}
# copied to us-east-2
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-138-165-109 ~]$ aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id ami-04cba4f37077b5859 --source-region us-east-1 --region us-east-2 --name "udacity-seidler"
{
    "ImageId": "ami-079c1d9ce4279da0e"
}

# copied to us-west-1
[cloudshell-user@ip-10-138-165-109 ~]$ aws ec2 copy-image --source-image-id ami-04cba4f37077b5859 --source-region us-east-1 --region us-west-1 --name "udacity-seidler"
{
    "ImageId": "ami-0c54ebd2d4284ad2f"
}


don't forget to create an IAM user and configure the cloudshell to use that user


High-level steps
- optional: aws sts get-caller-identity to confirm creds are still in good shape
- terraform apply
- update the kubectl config via `aws eks...` if needed and run terraform apply again
    - before doing that, run a plan to make sure cluster won't be recreated. Add AZ *-2c per the tf plan output

got it deployed. wasn't able to install prom/grafana due to failed helm deploy.
- will need to update values.yaml
- check previous project for details about this
    - https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/788661 for how to get helm properly installed. this worked for project 1
- alternate prometheus installation worked
- grafana login needs to be the load balancer DNS prefixed with http:// since port 443 isn't open
- lastly, make sure to include both email and username and public IP when doing the postman registration
    - without all three bits, the user registration won't work, it'll server error



confusing as hell:
- need to remove an AZ 2c to create all the resource on initial tf init
- but there's a step where you have to run tf apply for a second time, and at that point it says having that AZ missing causes the whole cluster to be recreated?
  this blows.
